# Tkinter Work for the Week ending April 10
---
You are to complete 9.3.  This is one of those PLTW assignments where a bunch of source code is given and now you have to come up with ways to make it work.  What I would like is the working code for all of the walkthroughs with your own comments on the code explaining what you did.

It stinks to work on these things by yourself.  I suggest you webex, slack, or zoom with some classmates and work on these together. I am happy to facilitate this process.  We will discuss further during our webex session (Tuesday April 7 at 12:10pm)
