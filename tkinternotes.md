# Notes on Tkinter

## What is Tkinter?
Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of [Tcl/Tk](http://tcl.tk).

## What is Tcl/Tk?
Tk is a graphical user interface toolkit that takes developing desktop applications to a higher level than conventional approaches. Tk is the standard GUI not only for Tcl, but for many other dynamic languages, and can produce rich, native applications that run unchanged across Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and more.

## Are there other GUI libraries for Python?
Yes!!  These include Kivy, Qt, WX and more.

## Why are we learning Tkinter?
For starters it comes preinstalled with Python.  Also many of these GUI building libraries are pretty similar.  If you learn Tk then you can easily learn others that might be a better fit for your project.

## What is this GUI you speak of and is it really gooey?

Since the coming of the operating system there is a way for users to interact with graphics instead of the command line. So far we have dealt solely with the command line interface (CLI), this includes printing using the `print()`function and user keystrokes using the  `input()` command.

## Discussion Questions
1. HCI asks, **“How do we get information from computing machines?” How do we provide information to the computer?** As technology advances, new methods for HCI emerge. For example, in the near future we will obtain information from computers using three-dimensional displays. Computers could also give us information by applying pressure against our skin or stimulating our senses of taste and smell. In the future we will send information to the computer with body gestures and eye movements. Even mind reading is possible, since we now know more about how to detect and interpret the patterns of activity inside our brains. **Can you think of other methods of communication between humans and computers?**

2. Accessibility is also an important part of HCI. An interface can exclude people based on the language they speak, the type of computer they have, or disabilities they have. If HCI designers do their job thoughtfully, more people can benefit from computing. For example, a guideline for web pages is to include descriptive text that can be displayed instead of an image on the page so that a blind person can benefit from the content of the page. **What guideline would make a web page accessible to a deaf person?**

3. Think of a website, an app, or a program that you found so frustrating that you chose not to use it. **Do you have advice about how it should have been designed?**

4. **With Moore's Law in mind, how do you think we will be interfacing with machines in 10 years?**
